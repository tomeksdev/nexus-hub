# Load testing

`tests/load/baseline.js` is a k6 script that drives the three endpoints that dominate production traffic:

| Endpoint | Per-user cadence | Why it's hot |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` | every 15 min | Access token expiry |
| `GET /api/v1/peers?interface_id=...` | every 10 s | Dashboard auto-refresh |
| `GET /api/v1/metrics` | every 15 s | Prometheus scrape |

## Running

```sh
k6 run \
  -e NEXUSHUB_URL=https://nexushub.example.com \
  -e NEXUSHUB_EMAIL=admin@example.com \
  -e NEXUSHUB_PASSWORD="$NEXUSHUB_PASSWORD" \
  tests/load/baseline.js
```

The ramp profile is 20 VUs baseline -> 50 VUs peak over ~5 minutes. One VU is roughly one browser session; 50 concurrent operators is generous for a VPN admin panel.

## Baseline SLOs

The script's `thresholds` block encodes the targets we commit to hold in production. A failing run means either the target deployment needs investigation or the SLO is wrong - bump the threshold deliberately if the latter, file an issue if the former.

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| `http_req_failed` | <1% |
| `http_req_duration` (p95) | <400 ms |
| `refresh_latency` (p95) | <200 ms |
| `peer_list_latency` (p95) | <300 ms |
| `metrics_latency` (p95) | <150 ms |

Targets assume:

- Backend and Postgres on the same host (or low-latency LAN).
- Postgres pool at the default 25 max connections.
- No eBPF rule maps full (the reconciler has the map-full signal on the Prometheus dashboard; watch `nexushub_ebpf_map_entries / nexushub_ebpf_map_capacity`).

## Regression hunting

`summaryTrendStats` is set to `avg, min, med, p(95), p(99), max`, so a regression shows up as a shifted p95/p99 without needing to post-process the CSV. Capture the summary output in CI (or a periodic job) and diff against the last green run to catch drift before users notice.

## What this doesn't cover

- **Auth lockout behaviour** - the script uses one shared account; the 5-failure lockout is not exercised.
- **WebSocket / SSE streams** - `/api/v1/peers/events` stays open for the length of a tab's lifetime; k6 doesn't model that here. A separate soak test is the right tool if you need to validate SSE memory behaviour.
- **eBPF hot path** - load landing on the API via XDP/TC hooks is kernel-side behaviour that a user-space k6 cannot measure. Use `iperf3` through the tunnel or `bpftool prog profile` for that.
